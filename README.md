# positiveSOUL AI Coach — API

The **official API for positiveSOUL AI Coach**, a guidance-based AI designed for education.  
Built to **guide, not give** — helping students, teachers, and school leaders think, create, and learn responsibly.

## Overview
- **Frontend:** https://positivesoul-ai.vercel.app/coach  
- **Repository:** https://github.com/positiveSOUL-ai/positivesoul-api  
- **Purpose:** This API connects the web interface with the `brain/ruleset.md`, enabling context-aware, role-based guidance for learning.

## File Structure
```
brain/             → Context, memory, and ruleset logic  
pages/             → Frontend React/Next.js components  
pages/api/coach.js → API route that communicates with the AI backend  
package.json       → Dependencies and scripts  
```

## Philosophy
The **positiveSOUL AI Coach** guides users toward independent thinking and creative learning — never completing assignments, but always helping users plan, structure, and reflect.
